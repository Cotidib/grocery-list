Practice project made with React Js and React Hooks

This is my version of the Color Generator project in ['Code 15 React Projects' course by John Smilga](https://youtu.be/a_7Z7C_JCyo).

### Overview and Learnings

Main React functionalities I learned: adding and removing elements dynamically, rendering alerts, edit mode and local storage. I made my own setup and styling.
